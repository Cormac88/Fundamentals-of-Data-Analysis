## Install

### Installing Python and Jupyter Notebook

1. Python and jupyter lab are needed to run the `.ipnb` files in this repository.

1. Download `Python` from https://www.python.org/.

2. Type `pip install jupyterlab` and press enter.

3. Wait for jupyter to finish installing.

Please see the official [Installation of Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html) page if you are having issues.

### Installing Ghostscript

Download and Install [Ghostscript](https://www.ghostscript.com/releases/gsdnld.html). Choose public license 64 bit.

### Installing Camelot

Install [Camelot](https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/) using the command pip install `camelot-py[cv]` in the command prompt.

Please see the official [Installation of Camelot](https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/install.html) page if you are having issues.

## Running the Code

### Running the Code

1. Change directory to the folder that contains the.ipynb file you wish to run.

2. Type `jupyter lab`.

3. Jupyter lab will open in your browser as a new tab. Keep the command prompt window open as it needs to stay running while Jupyter Notebook is active.

4. Click on the `.ipynb` file you wish to run.

5. Click on `Kernel` and then select `Restart Kernal and Run All Cells`.

6. When finished, close the tab in your browser and then press press 'ctrl + C' in the command prompt to end the session.
